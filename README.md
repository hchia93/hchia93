## About Me

Hi, I'm Hyrex, a **Gameplay Programmer** with over **7 years of experience** in the game industry.
I have been a part of shipped AAA & AA games, contributed and implemented gameplay features using various **C++ based game engines**, such as **Unreal Engine 4/5, Luminous Engine, CryEngine, and the prosperity one**. 

## Shipped Titles
### Skull & Bones: 
* **Owned, designed, implemented and maintained gameplay systems** including mailbox (runtime/gameplay command/backend/account persistency), codex (data structure), blueprint/crafting (progression gating), shoppinglist/tracker (data persistency consolidation), security (server-sided gameplay command validations), captain customization (UI implementation/currency supports)
* **Developed, and maintained gameplay feature adjacent tooling**, including extending ImGui debug tools, write auto-test script to ensure logic flow correctness, and prevent unindented API usage and issue regressions.
* **Collaborated with cross-functional and external teams**, produced technical documentation via Confluence, Miro, and resolving issues via JIRA, integrated with Perforce workflows.
* **Participated in playeraccount data handling and data commits to backends**, ensured player data integrity, reduced data loses when server crashed.
  
### Sniper Ghost Warrior(Contract):
* **Performed partial engine upgrade** and implemented `curl` into the project, enabled multiplayer implementations.
* **Fixed issues for UI components** in ActionScripts, improved UI navigation experiences.
* **Supported TRC and Platform compliances** for XBOX and PSN, reduced submission blockers.

### Final Fantasy XV: 
* **Investigated assigned issues as co-dev partner**, proposed solution and prepared code shelves for reviews.
* **Maintained and Extending in-game debug menu** upon QA's request and improved console debugging efficiency.
* **Debugged and optimized assigned scenes** for specific levels, improved performance and resolved blockers.
      
## Personal Project Builds
These projects showcase my C++ and game development skills through hands-on implementation:
* **[Project Nima](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aHa33I2-znXrFd1QMnyLHrO3xCOqvIcn/view?usp=drive_link):** Built and upgraded a 3D puzzle game from Unreal Engine 4 to 5, featuring rotatable cube puzzle, interaction and level progression.
* **[Project Fish](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17hUXWRPUCUvkPjyif2EEIAQLEkhOZqwK/view?usp=drive_link):** Built an exploration project in Unreal Engine 5, implemented combo system using Animation State Machines.
* **[Escape From Wizard](https://github.com/hchia93/escape-from-wizard):** Built a demo of an escape game, featuring A* pathfinding algorithm for the enemy to search and reach to player.
