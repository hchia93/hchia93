## About Me

Hi, I'm Hyrex, a seasoned **Gameplay Programmer** with over **8 years of experience** in the game industry. My journey has involved significant contributions to multiple AAA projects, leveraging expertise across various **C++ game engines**, including **Unreal Engine, Luminous Engine, CryEngine, and Anvil**. I have a strong passion for developing robust and efficient gameplay systems.

Feel free to connect with me for remote work opportunities.

## Shipped Titles

### Final Fantasy XV: 
* **Engine:** Luminous Engine
* **Contributions:**
    * **Debugged and optimized core gameplay systems** within critical areas (Titans Area, Adamantoise Boss fight, Zu Boss fight) to enhance performance and stability.
    * **Developed and maintained in-game debug menus** for efficient console-based issue diagnosis and workflow improvements.
      
### Sniper Ghost Warrior(Contract):
- * **Contributions:**
    * **Integrated outdated CryEngine systems with `curl`** to enable and stabilize multiplayer functionality.
    * **Implemented and debugged UI elements** for the weapon layout menu, improving user experience.


### Skull & Bones: 
* **Engine:** Anvil
    * **Collection/Codex:** Designed and implemented **C++ Linked-array structures** for hierarchical item grouping and UI layering.
    * **Mailbox System:** Engineered comprehensive client, server, and backend logic for mail notification, item claims, grants, removals, and rollback mechanisms, ensuring data integrity.
    * **Blueprint/Crafting:** Programmed **progression gating systems** for item crafting, controlling player advancement.
    * **Shopping List / Tracker:** Consolidated data persistence across multiple core systems (blueprints, crafting, objectives, world events, pirate affairs) for unified tracking and ensure its consistency after re-login.
    * **Security:** Integrated **server-side security validations** for critical commands to prevent exploits on owned features.
    * **UI/UX:** Collaborated on **high-priority UI/UX bug fixes** to meet aggressive release deadlines.
    * **Captain Customization:** Took ownership of a legacy module, **refactoring vendor logic** to support soft and hard currencies. Took ownership in fixing captain customization related UI which usually falls on tech-art domains.
    * **Tools:** Developed **ImGui-based debugging and auto-test scripts** for various gameplay systems, significantly streamlining development and QA processes.

## Personal Project Builds
These projects showcase my C++ and game development skills through hands-on implementation:
* **[Project Nima](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aHa33I2-znXrFd1QMnyLHrO3xCOqvIcn/view?usp=drive_link):** A 3D puzzle game developed used to develop in UE4, now upgradated to UE5, focusing on controllable cube mechanics and level progression. 
* **[Project Fish](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17hUXWRPUCUvkPjyif2EEIAQLEkhOZqwK/view?usp=drive_link):** An exploration project in UE5, focusing on advanced **Animation State Machines** and **combo system implementation**.
* **[Escape From Wizard](https://github.com/hchia93/escape-from-wizard):** Developed during University, demonstrating A* Pathfinding Algorithm implementation for optimal shortest path solutions in a collection-based game.
